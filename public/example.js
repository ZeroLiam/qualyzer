If you aren&rsquo;t uncomfortable and have a disconnect with your natal sex, why would you want to transition? The discomfort and disconnect is what dysphoria is. Dysphoria can be with how you&rsquo;re perceived or how you feel your own body should look like <i><b>in relation to your gender.</b></i></p><p>If you&rsquo;re actually trans and think you&rsquo;re &ldquo;non-dysphoric,&rdquo; you probably just have the wrong idea of what dysphoria is and are actually dysphoric. <b>However, those who have no discomfort or disconnect with their gender are cis.</b></p>",
